# YouTube_Data_Harvesting_and_Warehousing
This is my First Project
This project aims to develop a user-friendly Streamlit application that utilizes the Google API to extract information on a YouTube channel, stores it in a SQL database, and enables users to search for channel details and join tables to view data in the Streamlit app
